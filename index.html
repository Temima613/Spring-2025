                <h1 id="2">What Is Ransomware?</h1>
                <p>Imagine logging into your computer one day only to find that all your files—pictures, homework, and even your favorite games—are locked. A scary message pops up saying you have to pay money to get them back. This is ransomware, a type of malware (malicious software) used by cybercriminals to extort money from victims.</p>

                <h1 id="3">A Brief History of Ransomware</h1>
                <p>Ransomware has come a long way since it first appeared. In 1989, the first ransomware, called the AIDS Trojan, was distributed through floppy disks. The ransom? A payment sent by mail!</p>
                <p>Fast forward to the 2010s, and ransomware evolved to target businesses, hospitals, and even government systems. Hackers started demanding payments in Bitcoin, a type of cryptocurrency, because it’s harder to trace. One of the most infamous ransomware attacks, WannaCry in 2017, infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide in just a few days.</p>
                <p>Today, ransomware is more sophisticated. Hackers may threaten to leak sensitive data online if the ransom isn’t paid. This double-threat tactic makes it even more dangerous.</p>

                <h2 id="4">How Does Ransomware Spread?</h2>
                <img id="Hacker Image" src="HW1_Blog_Image_2.jpg" height="550" width="850" alt="Hacker">
                <p>Ransomware can sneak into your system in many ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Phishing Emails: Hackers send fake emails designed to look legitimate, tricking you into clicking a malicious link or downloading a harmful attachment.</li>
                    <li>Malicious Websites: Some websites are set up specifically to install malware on your device. These can be disguised as free download sites, pop-up ads, or even fake news articles.</li>
                    <li>Software Vulnerabilities: When your software isn't updated, it can contain bugs or weak points that hackers exploit to gain access to your system.</li>
                </ul>
